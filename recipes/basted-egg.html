        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>This recipe produces a delicious, simple egg with satisfying, set whites and a creamy, runny yolk. It's similar to a poached egg, but more flavorful and less fussy.</p>


        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1½ tablespoons salted butter </li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of water</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch flaky sea salt, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Melt butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. 
                Carefully crack eggs into the skillet and let cook until whites have almost set, about 1 minute.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add water, cover skillet with a lid or cookie sheet, reduce heat to medium-low, 
                and let cook until whites have set, yolks are still runny, and some of white has set over yolk, 
                1 to 2 more minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Remove lid and transfer eggs to a serving plate. Garnish with pepper and flaky salt,
                if desired. Serve immediately.</p></li>
        </ol>
